## What are the lower and upper bounds for a confidence interval of 99%?

This is only dependent of the $z$-value:

```{r}
z_99 <- qnorm(1 - .01/2)
z_99
```

The boundaries are $\pm 2.575829$.

We can also calculate this for a confidence interval of 95%:

```{r}
z_95 <- qnorm(1 - .05/2)
z_95
```

## A confidence interval of 99% is wider than a confidence interval for 95%. Why?

If you want to be more sure that the (unknown) population mean is inside the interval, you need to increase the width of the interval.

## What would be the confidence interval for a confidence level of 100\%?

As the confidence interval approaches 100%, the interval gets wider.
There is no hard boundary, so the interval becomes $]-\infty, +\infty[$.
You can never be a 100% certain that the population mean is located in a finite interval, hence the use of infinity.
