# Coding Examples

The purpose of this directory is to collect coding examples in R for all concepts covered in the course. The examples are broken down by course chapter.

If you have a request for an addition, or an adjustment / improvement, do not hesitate to create an Issue! Or when an explanation seems incomplete or confusing, you can certainly indicate this.

Some examples are based on `knitr`, others on `learnr`. Both are libraries you will have to install. You can do this in RStudio at the bottom right of the Packages tab.

The documents are formatted in R Markdown (.Rmd) and can be opened using RStudio. Once opened, press the "Knit" or "Run Document" button on top.
